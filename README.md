# 📄 Upload Contracts and Ask Questions About Terms & Clauses

This project enables users to upload contract PDFs and interact with them using natural language queries. It leverages OpenAI for understanding contract content and fetch relevant clauses as response.

## ✨ Key Features

  Ensures the same contract isn't processed multiple times by checking for semantic similarity.

- 🧠 **Clause Chunking and Embedding for Efficient Retrieval**  
  Contracts are broken into meaningful chunks and embedded for fast semantic search.

- 🔍 **Chat-based Q&A on Contract Content Using OpenAI**  
  Ask natural language questions and get answers backed by specific clauses.

- ✨ **Highlighting of Matched Text in the PDF**  
  AI-selected clauses are visually highlighted in the original PDF for easy review.

- ⚡ **Fast and Optimized Processing Pipeline**  
  Built for performance with a focus on speed and cost-efficiency.
